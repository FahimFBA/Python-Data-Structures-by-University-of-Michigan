# A list can hold many items and keeps those items in the order until we do something to change the order.

customer = ['Alice' , 'Orca' , 'Sansa' ,'Joffry' , 'Rumel']
customer.sort()
print(customer)
print(customer[2])

# A list can be sorted (i.e., change its order)

# The sort method (unlike in strings) means "sort yourself"
