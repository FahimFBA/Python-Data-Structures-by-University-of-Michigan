Question 1
How are Python dictionaries different from Python lists?
Python lists are indexed using integers and dictionaries can use strings as indexes
Python dictionaries are a collection and lists are not a collection
Python lists can store strings and dictionaries can only store words
Python lists store multiple values and dictionaries store a single value
